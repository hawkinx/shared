# Shared stuff

Repo for sharing markdown documents, scripts and other files with colleagues. No environment specific variables/settings/whatever, just generic files

If anybody else finds something useful here, use at your own risk etc. Also make sure you grab your own copy as some/most/all of the content will be removed when it no longer needs to be shared
